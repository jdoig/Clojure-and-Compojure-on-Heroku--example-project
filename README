# example

A very (very) simple example of Clojure + Compojure project that can run on Heroku's Cedar stack.
Get Requests will serve up <h3>Resource not found</h3> and /:name will return a {"name" : <:name arg here> } json object.

##Note: defroutes (GET "/" [] ... was causing me no end of problems; it worked fine, locally, on my box but not on Heroku. 
Using GET "/*" fixes this but catches all request, So currently I'm just relying on route/not-found to resolve "/" requests...

The Procfile is the key to getting it running on Heroku:
	web: lein run -m example.core
This is an instruction for a "web" process that tells it to run the -main method in core.server

## Usage
Sign up with Heroku, 
Follow instruction's here: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart
BUT create a new app on the cedar stack with: 
	> heroku create --stack cedar
instead of just "heroku create"
Then git push heroku master
